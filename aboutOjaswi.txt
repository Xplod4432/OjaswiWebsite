and its members to shine the brightest and to prove one’s worth to the world. When everything had come to a standstill, the founders (under the aegis of Division of 
Student Welfare, Lovely Professional University) saw an opportunity to get things moving and to open the possibilities of hosting events online. This opened new 
possibilities of learning and interacting with personalities hailing from different arenas, which would not have been possible in the physical/offline mode. 

Be it interacting with celebrities and being inspired by their story or workshops to quench the audience’s thirst for knowledge and competitions to challenge one’s skills, 
OJASWI has hosted it all. The credit for organization’s steady climb in the ranks only belongs to its hardworking and ever determined leaders and members.
