The launching of Student Organisation Ojaswi under the aegis of Division of Student Welfare, Lovely Professional University was done on 6th August 2020 at 6 pm on the official Instagram handle of Ojaswi. 
“All the Ojaswians are candidly ready with the same amount of brightness that the word Ojaswi suggests and with all the strength that a team holds within. Every single confederate here at our work stead is ready with all the positivity and energy that is going to assist us all to triumph towards our vision and goal, i.e., the determination to shine. We are all ready to provide the best environment to all our mates, present out there probing for a long time, for some events that provide the overall development at full swing. Being associated to the Division of Student Welfare, Lovely Professional University, it is a great opportunity for us all to eliminate the words like ‘domination’ and to instigate the words like ‘leadership’ and ‘teamwork’ to all of us.”

The motto “Determine to shine” and abilities of the mythical Phoenix, which rises from its own ashes to its magnificent form, shows the perseverance of the organisation 
and its members to shine the brightest and to prove one’s worth to the world. When everything had come to a standstill, the founders (under the aegis of Division of 
Student Welfare, Lovely Professional University) saw an opportunity to get things moving and to open the possibilities of hosting events online. This opened new 
possibilities of learning and interacting with personalities hailing from different arenas, which would not have been possible in the physical/offline mode. 

Be it interacting with celebrities and being inspired by their story or workshops to quench the audience’s thirst for knowledge and competitions to challenge one’s skills, 
OJASWI has hosted it all. The credit for organization’s steady climb in the ranks only belongs to its hardworking and ever determined leaders and members.
